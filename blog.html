                <h2 class="section-title">Short Story: The Dentist Visit</h2>
                <p>
                    Every day as I walked back home from school, I would always
                    buy myself a lollipop. Growing up in town, licking lollipops
                    was my favourite thing. One night, I had a very serious pain
                    in my tooth. I told my parents about it, and they gave me a
                    painkiller to reduce the pain. Early in the morning, I woke
                    up totally fine, like nothing had happened the previous
                    night. I went to the bathroom, grabbed my toothbrush, and
                    started brushing. Suddenly, I began to feel pain in my
                    tooth. The pain got worse every second, as if brushing was
                    an “increase pain” button. I tried to take the painkillers I
                    had used the previous night, but it seemed to be getting
                    worse. I told my parents about the situation, and they took
                    me to the dentist. “Good morning,” said my mom to the
                    receptionist. “Good morning, ma’am,” replied the
                    receptionist. “How can I help today?” “My son has an
                    appointment with Dr. Mark,” my mom replied. “Well, he’s
                    inside his office upstairs.” “Thanks.” “My pleasure,” said
                    the receptionist. We went upstairs to his office. While he
                    was having a conversation with my mom, I was buried in
                    thoughts about how painful it would be to remove my tooth.
                    After a short conversation with my mom, he said to me,
                    “Follow me, son.” I followed him to the room where he
                    performs extractions. Inside was a large dental chair, and
                    on the table were many tools. Immediately, my heart began to
                    race. As I looked at the tools, I imagined how painful the
                    procedure would be. “Are you scared, son?” said the dentist.
                    “The procedure won’t be painful, because we use a special
                    drug that makes you not feel pain.” I was relieved by what
                    he said. After carefully examining my teeth, he said he had
                    to remove the tooth that was infected. I nodded fearfully.
                    He gave me an injection to avoid the pain. After the
                    removal, he gave me medicine to take whenever I experienced
                    pain. I then went back to my mom in the waiting room. After
                    we went home, I never experienced pain in that tooth again.

                    Essay: Forms of Violence in South Sudan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every day, people lose their lives due to violence. Violence
                    exists in different forms, from gender-based violence to
                    sexual abuse and others. In this essay, we are going to
                    discuss forms of violence in South Sudan and their possible
                    solutions. Firstly, let us define violence. Violence is an
                    action that causes destruction, pain, or suffering. In South
                    Sudan, people suffer from violence almost every day. One
                    common form of violence is intercommunal violence, which
                    arises from disputes between two or more communities.
                    Moreover, the common causes of intercommunal violence
                    include cultural differences, competition over natural
                    resources, and other related factors. However, it is worth
                    noting that intercommunal violence is not the only form of
                    violence. Sexual abuse, for example, is another major form
                    of violence in South Sudan. One possible solution to sexual
                    abuse is to sensitise communities about the importance of
                    cultural values and personal dignity. People should also be
                    educated about health risks such as sexually transmitted
                    infections (STIs) associated with sexual violence, including
                    rape. In conclusion, it is the responsibility of every
                    individual to promote peace and reduce deaths and injuries
                    caused by violence.
